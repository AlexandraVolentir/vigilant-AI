The decision tree algorithm is a powerful supervised learning algorithm widely used in Artificial Intelligence.
1. We consider all the training set as our root. 
2. We consider the attributes to be categorical for information gain and for gini index, and, they are considered continuous as well.
3. Records are distributed recursively.
4. Statistical methods are used for attributes as root or internal node.

The logic of the program follows the following thought:
1. We find the best attributes and put them on the root node
2.
